# Aysnchronous Apex

## Future Apex
* Future Apex is used to run processes in a separate thread, at a later time when system resources become available.
* When using synchronous processing, all method calls are made from the same thread that is executing the Apex code, and no additional processing can occur until the process is complete. 
* <b>thread</b> of execution is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.
